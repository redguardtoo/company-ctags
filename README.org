* Fastest auto-completion using Company and Ctags

This library enables the completion using [[http://company-mode.github.io][Company mode]] and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ctags][Ctags]] for Emacs. It's *simply fast* because a new optimized algorithm is designed for Ctags.

It shows the candidate immediately for project as big as Linux kernel.

* Install and Setup
Place =company-ctags.el= under [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/LoadPath][Load Path]], then add =(require 'company-ctags)= to your configuration.

It’s also possible to use [[http://melpa.org/]].

Setup is simple,
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(eval-after-load 'company
  '(progn
     (company-ctags-auto-setup)))
#+END_SRC
* Usage
Step 1, create tags file in project root,
#+begin_src sh
find . -name "*.[ch]" | ctags -e -L -
#+end_src

Step 2, enjoy!
* Tips
** Load extra tags files
You can set =company-ctags-extra-tags-files= to load extra tags files,

#+begin_src elisp
(setq company-ctags-extra-tags-files '("$HOME/TAGS" "/usr/include/TAGS"))
#+end_src

** Use CLI program diff to improve performance
Make sure CLI program =diff= is executable on Windows.

It's optional but highly recommended.  It can speed up tags file updating.

This package uses diff through variable =diff-command=.

Linux/macOS needs no setup.
** Fuzzy match
Set =company-ctags-fuzzy-match-p= to fuzzy match the candidates.

The input could match any part of the candidate instead of the beginning of the candidate.

Here is example how to combine [[https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper/blob/master/counsel.el][counsel]] with =company-ctags=,
#+begin_src elisp
(require 'counsel)
(defun my-counsel-company ()
  "Input code from company backend using fuzzy matching."
  (interactive)
  (company-abort)
  (let* ((company-backends '(company-ctags))
         (company-ctags-fuzzy-match-p t))
    (counsel-company)))
#+end_src

You can use [[https://github.com/noctuid/general.el][general.el]] so you could press =rr= in insert mode to trigger =my-counsel-company=,
#+begin_src elisp
;; In insert mode, press "rr" in 0.2 second to trigger my-counsel-company
(require 'general)
(general-imap "r"
  (general-key-dispatch 'self-insert-command
    :timeout 0.2
    "r" 'my-counsel-company))
#+end_src
** Rust programming language
Use [[https://github.com/dan-t/rusty-tags][rusty-tags]] to generate tags file for Rust programming language.

Add below code into ~/.emacs,
#+begin_src elisp
(setq company-ctags-tags-file-name "rusty-tags.emacs")
#+end_src
